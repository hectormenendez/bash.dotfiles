Grab a cup of coffee, browse reddit, swipe on tinderâ€¦ it's gonna take a while.

Once installed the installer will be availabel globally as `dotfiles-install` you can pass
you can pass arguments to it to setup/reinstall parts of the dotfiles.

**Arguments**

-  `--skip` skip installations steps or packages. Note you can pass a comma-separated list
            list of vales. `--skip=links,brew,emacs` just remember not to use spaces.

             package pass `--force=packages`


## Binaries

Well, not really binaries, but you get the point. I included some scripts I use regularly
when working with the tools included here. There are adapted to work for my needs,
so don't judge. ðŸ˜’
